This script is for transcribing mp4 video files. It features a GUI using PyQT5.

Please note that does NOT include timestamps. This simply outputs the audio from a mp4 into a .txt file.

This repo is a slight spin off from vid2speech created by Dr. Alan Davies. You can find his tutorial for this [here.](https://towardsdatascience.com/transcribing-interview-data-from-video-to-text-with-python-5cdb6689eea1)
